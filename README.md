Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data about Russia-Ukraine Tweets

**Introduction**

The Russo-Ukrainian conflict escalated in February 2022 after Russia recognised two Ukrainian breakaway regions - the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic. On 21 February 2022, Russia officially recognised the two self-proclaimed separatist states in the Donbas, and sent troops to the territories. Three days later, Russia invaded Ukraine after Putin announced a "special military operation". Much of the international community and organizations such as Amnesty International have condemned Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and violating Ukrainian sovereignty.  
People around the world have different takes on this. There are people who support Ukraine while there are also people who agree with Russia’s decision on going to war. So, by using the tweets on Twitter, I am going to understand people’s sentiments on Russia going to war against Ukraine and as to what the majority of people support and in order to do this, I will use Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling to discover the latent topics of an unstructured collection of documents and organize the collection according to the discovered topics.

**Dataset Description**

Data was collected from Twitter. I found the tweets on Twitter which are related to the Russia - Ukraine war and analyzed them. The data was collected mainly from the following hashtags - #RussianUkrainianWar, #UkraineUnderAttaсk, #UkraineRussiaWar, #RussiaUkraineConflict. I have selected only these hashtags as they give me the direct data regarding the latest Russia-Ukraine war and not other matters in which Russia/Ukraine are involved. I have collected the data in the dates between 2022-03-05 and 2022-03-23. I collected 300 tweets from each hashtag and merged all the datasets into one dataframe which I have used further to analyze and answer the research questions. 

**Conclusion**

From the Sentiment Analysis, we can clearly observe that most of the people are having a negative sentiment toward the war. They are against it.  By the results of LDA, we can clearly notice that most people have positive sentiments towards Ukraine and negative sentiments towards Russia. The hashtags clearly reflect how they support Ukraine and are against the war by Russia.
